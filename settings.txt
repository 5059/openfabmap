##### FUNCTION #####
# 1 - View Features on a Video
# 2 - Build Codebook
# 3 - View Words on a Video
# 4 - Build ChowLiuTree
# 5 - Full PDF Calculation. Each frame added 
	- (FAB_MAP 1.0 as in Cummins et. al. without the Pior on position)
# 6 - FBO PDF Calculation. Frames added when a 'new location' is 
	- largest probability (as in Glover et. al.). Also the Fast-Bailout is
	- implemented in this function.
# 7 - Visualise FABMAP results from results file

#a large amount of data is required to store the mutual information used to
#create the minimum spanning tree. Increasing the threshold means that less
#data is stored however COULD reduce the tree performance or cause it not to
#finish building. e.g. 8000 word codebook requires 1.2 Gb RAM.
#A threshold of 0 is zero risk to performance but takes longer and may fail
